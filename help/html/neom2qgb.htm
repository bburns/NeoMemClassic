<P>The <B>Edit Link Dialog</B> lets you modify the value of a <B>link property</B>. A link property is a property that can point to another object or objects in the current file. From this dialog you can select the link objects, add new link objects, or edit existing ones.</P>

<TD width=18%><B>Allow more than one selection</B></TD>
<TD width=82%>Checking this option will allow you to link to more than one object. Click the square next to an object to select or deselect it. Note that some link properties only allow linking to one object - in this case, this checkbox will be disabled (grayed out).

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%><B>New Sibling...</B></TD>
<TD width=82%>Clicking this button will let you add a new object to the list - the object will be added to the <B>link source folder</B> as defined by the link property being edited. The object will be added as a sibling of the currently selected object - if you need to add a child object, use the <B>New Child</B> button instead.

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%><B>New Child...</B></TD>
<TD width=82%>In some cases you may need to add a new child object instead of a sibling object. For instance, if you were setting up a hierarchy of locations, you might need to add "Houston" under "Texas". In this case, use the <B>New Child</B> button instead of the <B>New</B> button, and the new object will be added as a child of the currently selected object. If you make a mistake you can always delete the object you just added and try again.
