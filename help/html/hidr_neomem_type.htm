<P>Overview</P>

<P><B>What is NeoMem?</B></P>

<P>NeoMem is a program you can use to store all kinds of information - things to do lists, book collections, website passwords, music collections, shopping lists, addresses, and many other kinds of information. It can be thought of as a combination <B>Word Processor</B> and <B>Database,</B> with an interface that is similar to <B>Windows Explorer</B>. </P>

<P>Each object can store text information with a simple word processor view, and you can create different types of objects and create properties that describe them. Each object can also contain any number of child objects. Using the <B>Class Wizard,</B> you can easily create your own classes (object types) and the properties that describe them.</P>

<P><B>Where to start</B></P>

<P>If you are just getting started, you might want to take a look at the <A HREF="example_file.htm">example file</A> included with the program. It includes several examples of the types of information you can store with the program and a tutorial on various features.</P>

<P>You can also read the overviews on various topics, including <A HREF="folders_and_objects.htm">Folders and Objects</A>, <A HREF="classes_and_properties.htm">Classes and Properties</A>, and <A HREF="views_overview.htm">Views</A>. </P>

<P><B>How does it work?</B></P>

<P>You can think of each object in the file as being a box into which you can put any number of other objects and property values. Child objects are displayed in the <B>Contents View</B>, and the property values are displayed in the <B>Properties View</B>. </P>
