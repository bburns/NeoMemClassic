<P>Changing the Class of an Object</P>

<P>Each object in a NeoMem file is associated with a <B>class</B>. This class determines which icon is displayed with the object, what properties are displayed in the <B>Properties View</B>, and what views are available for the object. You can change the class of an object by right clicking on it and selecting <B>Change Class... </B>from the popup menu (or clicking on the object and selecting <B>Object / Change Class...</B> from the main menu). This will bring up a dialog showing all the classes available in the current file - you can select the new class and hit <B>OK</B>, and the object will be changed to the new class. </P>

<P>Note: If the new class has different properties associated with it than the old class, and you had already entered information for the old class's properties, you can still access them through the <B>Properties View</B>. If they are no longer applicable for the object, you can delete them by clicking on the property value and hitting the <B>Delete</B> key. </P>
