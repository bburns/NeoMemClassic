<P>Navigating</P>

<P>To navigate around a NeoMem file, you simply click on the item you want to view in one of the three navigation views on the left side of the screen: <B>Data View</B>, <B>Search View</B>, or <B>Index View</B>. Information about that object will be displayed on the right side of the screen in different views. Different classes of objects may have different views available. For more information on views, see the <A HREF="neom5flj.htm">Views</A> topic.</P>

<P>If an object has a plus sign next to it in the <B>Data View</B>, that means it contains child objects. You can see its child objects by clicking on the <B>plus sign</B> to expand the object. You can also double click on the object to expand it. To "collapse" an object in the <B>Data View</B>, click on the <B>minus sign</B> next to it or double click on it.</P>

<P>You can also navigate around the file using the keyboard - from any view, you can use the arrow keys with the <B>Alt</B> key held down to select a new object on the left side of the screen. For instance, if you are typing something in the <B>Text View</B>, you can hit <B>Alt+Down</B> to go to the next object in the <B>Data View</B>, or whatever view happens to be visible on the left. You can jump to the top of the list with <B>Alt+Home</B>, or jump to the bottom with <B>Alt+End</B>. To expand or collapse items with children, you can hit <B>Alt+Right</B> or <B>Alt+Left</B>. </P>

<P>To switch between views using the keyboard, you can use <B>Alt+PgDn</B> and <B>Alt+PgUp</B> to cycle between the visible views, or type <B>Alt</B> plus the letter that is underlined in the view's name (for instance, <B>Alt+D </B>will take you to the <B>Data View</B>). </P>

<P>Note that to select an object you only need to click on it once.</P>
