<P>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</P>

<P>If you have a question that is not in this list, you can also check the latest FAQ at www.neomem.org/support.htm.</P>

<P><I><B>Q.</B> What's the difference between a folder object and other types of objects?</I></P>

<P><B>A.</B> Like all other objects, a <B>folder</B> object can store child objects and display them in the <B>Contents View</B>. Unlike other types of objects though, a folder object always gets its own unique column arrangement in the <B>Contents View</B>. Other objects use a column arrangement that is common to their class. For instance, if you had a <B>Tape </B>object with <B>Song</B>, <B>Band</B>, and <B>Length</B> properties displayed, all <B>Tape </B>objects would get the same column arrangement, and if you changed the arrangement in one tape, all other tapes would have the same arrangement. </P>

<P>The best way to arrange your file is to use folder objects to store your other objects. See the <A HREF="example_file.htm">example file</A> for some examples.</P>

<P><I><B>Q.</B> Why can't I move items up and down? The Move Up and Move Down buttons are disabled.</I></P>

<P><B>A. </B>The <B>Move Up </B>and <B>Move Down </B>buttons are enabled only if the currently selected object's parent has <B>autosort </B>turned off. If you right click on the parent object, you can turn off <B>autosort </B>for the object by unchecking the menu item. Then you can arrange the child objects in any order you wish. </P>
