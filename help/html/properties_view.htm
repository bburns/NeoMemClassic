<P>The <B>Properties View</B> shows the property values for the currently selected object. The class of the object determines the properties that will appear here. </P>

<P><B>Editing Values</B></P>

<P>Double clicking on any property value will bring up the <B>Edit Dialog</B> that is appropriate for that property type - hitting <B>F4</B> while on a cell will have the same effect. Hitting <B>F2</B> while on a cell will let you edit its contents in place, or you can just start typing over the existing value.</P>

<P>If you right click on a property value, you will get a popup menu that will give you access to the clipboard, and depending on the property type, will also display other commands. For instance, a <B>Link </B>property will display menu items letting you jump to the objects that are being linked to.</P>

<P>Note: If you change the class of an object which already has property values filled in, and the new class does not have the same properties associated with it, the old properties will still be visible in the <B>Properties View</B> - you can delete them if you wish by hitting the Delete key while on the property values. </P>
