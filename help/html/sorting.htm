<P>Sorting Objects, Autosort, Moving Items Up and Down</P>

<P>Normally all objects in NeoMem are automatically sorted alphabetically. For certain classes of objects, this may not be appropriate. For instance, if you're storing a list of songs on a CD, the order is not necessarily alphabetic. In this case, you can modify the CD class so that its child items will not be sorted. You can do this in the <A HREF="hidd_class_intro.htm">Class Wizard</A> when you are setting up a class, or modifying an existing class. You can also turn <B>autosort</B> on or off for a single object by right clicking on the object and selecting <B>Sort Subobjects Automatically</B> to it on and off (you can also click on the object and select <B>Object / Sort Subobjects Automatically</B> from the main menu).</P>

<P>For objects which have <B>autosort</B> turned off, you can change the order of the child objects by clicking on a child object and then clicking on the <B>Move Object Up</B> <IMG SRC="../images/btnmoveup.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> or <B>Move Object Down</B> <IMG SRC="../images/btnmovedown.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> buttons (or selecting <B>Object / Move Up</B> or <B>Move Down</B> from the main menu). This will move the object up or down relative to its siblings. </P>

<P>In the <B>Contents View</B>, you can temporarily sort the items by one of the columns by clicking on that column header. Clicking on it again will reverse the sort. You can also right click on a column header and select <B>Sort Ascending</B> or <B>Sort Descending</B> (or click on a cell in the column and select <B>View / Sort Column Ascending</B> or <B>Sort Column Descending</B> from the main menu). </P>

<P>Note: If you are sorting by a date column and any of the dates are stored as strings, they will always be sorted at the end - see <A HREF="properties.htm">Properties and Property Types</A> for more information. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/tip.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> You can also add a non-alphanumeric character (e.g. "_" or "@") before the name of an item that you want to appear first in a sort. This may be preferable to turning <B>autosort</B> off in some cases.</P>
