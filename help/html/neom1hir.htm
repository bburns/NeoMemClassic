<P>Limitations</P>

<P>Because NeoMem reads the entire file into memory, the number of objects and text it can contain is limited by the amount of memory available on your computer, and the memory used by other applications you have running. </P>

<P>Each object can store up to 16MB of text information in the <B>Text View</B>.</P>

<P>You can see how much memory your file is taking up by selecting <B>File / File Properties</B> from the main menu. The dialog will also show how many objects your file contains (see the <A HREF="neom1fsc.htm">File Properties Dialog</A> topic).</P>

<P>If your file starts getting too large, you can always split your file into two by saving it with a new name, then deleting objects from each file so that they are of a more manageable size. </P>

<P>For network users: please note that NeoMem files can only be used by one person at a time. Files are NOT locked during use, so be careful if you store NeoMem files on a network, as someone else could overwrite your changes if they use the same file at the same time.</P>
