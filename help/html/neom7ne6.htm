<P>Changing the Icon of an Object</P>

<P>Each object has an <B>icon</B> associated with it that is determined from its class. For instance, all Book objects might have an icon of a book. However, you can override the default icon for an individual object by right clicking on the object and selecting <B>Change Icon... </B>from the popup menu (or clicking on an object and selecting <B>Object / Change Icon...</B> from the main menu). This will bring up a dialog which will show all of the icons available to choose from. You can also create a new icon by clicking on the <B>Import...</B> button, which will let you select a Windows icon file to import (a file with a <B>.ico</B> extension). </P>

<P>Note: Any icon that you import will be stored in the current file only, and will <B>not</B> be available to other files unless you import it to them as well.</P>

<P><B>Changing Icons for a Class of Objects</B></P>

<P>To change the icon used to represent a class (in other words, so all objects of a class get a different icon), you can right click on an object and select <B>Change Class Icon... </B>from the popup menu (or click on the object and select <B>Object / Change Class Icon...</B> from the main menu). This will let you change the icon used to represent all objects of the same class. If any of the objects of the class have overridden their icons, then their icons will <B>not </B>change. You can also accomplish the same thing with the <B>Class Wizard</B>. See the <A HREF="neom5ub7.htm">Edit Class</A> topic for more information.</P>
