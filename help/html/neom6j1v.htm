<P>Class Wizard: Contents</P>

<P>In the <B>Contents </B>step, you can specify the <B>default class </B>for objects of the class you are creating or editing. This is simply the default class that will be selected when you add a child object. </P>

<P>For instance, if you were creating a <B>CD </B>class to store your CD's, you could select a <B>Song </B>class in this step, so that when you create a new CD object, then add a child object to it, the child object will by default be a Song object. If you have not created the child class yet, you can just continue on through the class wizard to finish creating the class, then create the child class, then come back and edit the original class to modify this step to select the child class. See the topic <A HREF="neom42ur.htm">Changing the Contents of an Object</A> for more information.</P>

<P>You can also specify if you want the children of objects of this class to be automatically sorted. In most cases, having them sorted is fine, but in some situations, you may want to select <B>No, let me arrange the child objects in any order</B>. For instance, with a CD class, you would want to select this so you could change the order of the songs on the CD as needed. See the topic <A HREF="neom1bvr.htm">Sorting Objects, Autosort and Moving Items Up and Down</A> for more information.</P>

<P>Note: You will not be limited to the default class when adding subobjects - the default class just saves you the step of specifying the class. You can always add a new object and select a different class for that object.</P>
