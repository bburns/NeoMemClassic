icons, buttons, toolbars, etc

and .rc files from visual studio
until can get away from that system

would be nice to split out neomem.rc into menus.rc, dialogs.rc, strings.rc, etc.
but vs probably wouldn't like that


note: to get better control over the version information, i made an .rct file, which is a template file for the actual .rc file. 



from msdn:
Visual C++ manages a single .RC resource file and a corresponding .H header file as a tightly coupled pair of files. When you edit and save resources in an .RC file, you indirectly edit and save symbols in the corresponding .H file. Although you can open and edit multiple .RC files at a time (using Visual C++'s MDI user interface) for any given .RC file you indirectly edit exactly one corresponding header file.
By default, Visual C++ always names the corresponding header file RESOURCE.H

RES\MYAPP.RC2
    Contains resources that will not be edited by Visual C++ but will be included in the final compiled .EXE file. AppWizard creates no such resources by default, since Visual C++ can edit all of the standard resources, including the version resource (a new feature in this release). An empty file is generated by AppWizard in case you wish to add your own custom formatted resources to this file. If you use custom formatted resources, you can add them to RES\MYAPP.RC2 and edit them using the Visual C++ text editor.
