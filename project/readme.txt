for now, only vs6 is being used
but could put it in a subfolder and add others if needed

eg
* linux-gcc
* mac
* win-gcc
* win-vs6
* ...


note: the neomem.opt file stores the vs6 project folder settings. 
but absurdly, it stores hardcoded paths!
so to see it correcly must put the project folder at
c:\projects\neomem\neomemC
ack!!
